## Dataset Description

Title: Motor Vehicle Collisions - Crashes

Source: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset

Description:
Our dataset contains the details of all police-reported motor vehicle collisions in NYC. We obtained our data set through the website provided (https://catalog.data.gov/dataset). Our dataset contains a very wide variety of dimensions with different data types. We have specific information on when each crash occurred and on what specific day. Both of these data types are date and time. Each collision also has its specific ID and contains the number of people in the car killed and injured, the number of cyclists killed and injured, the number of pedestrians killed and injured, and the number of motorists killed and injured. These dimensions are of data type number (whole). Some more dimensions in this dataset include the locations of every collision like the cross street name, off-street name, and the on-street name. Also, the type of vehicles involved, and the reason why they crashed are present in this data set. All of these dimensions are of data type string. Lastly, the dataset contains the zip code, latitude, and longitude of where every collision occurred. The zip code is a data type number(whole) and has a geographical role of zip code, and the latitude and longitude are data type number(decimal) with a geographical role of latitude and longitude. Altogether, our dataset offers a comprehensive and multifaceted perspective on motor vehicle collisions in NYC that allows us to dive deep into the dimensions of every collision. 


### Question 1

QUESTION: From 2012 to 2023 in NYC, what type of motor vehicle collision caused the most injuries and deaths?

IMPORTANCE: This question is significant because it allows people to understand the cause of frequent vehicle collision injuries within New York City. Through this visual, city officials can understand which type of accident is most frequent and which type of accident is most serious, causing the most fatalities. Furthermore, officials can observe and analyze trends in unsafe behavior, such as which type of collision has increased or has decreased. This is allowed as the data is presented over a range of years. Through the given information, city officials can create better programs to better educate against unsafe driving. They can use this information to prioritize which problems to tackle, given the trends, fatalities, and injuries presented. In addition, this information lets police know what to look out for more specifically and impose harder punishments on unsafe practices that have larger effects. This visual relates to the dataset as the data includes attributes among all collision injuries/deaths from 2012 to now.

Our investigation uncovered interesting trends in our search for the main factors contributing to motor vehicle collision injuries and fatalities in New York City between 2012 and 2023. The eleven-year period's most important contributing factors to traffic-related injuries and deaths are highlighted in the visualizations created from our large dataset.

The first graphic shows a trend in the number and severity of crashes, with "Driver Inattention/Distraction" standing out as the main contributor to injuries. This pattern emphasizes how important it is for drivers to be aware of their surroundings and how policy may help. Interestingly, even though the injury cases linked to "Failure to Yield Right-of-Way" and "Unsafe Speed" exhibit sporadic variations, driver distraction has continued to take precedence over them throughout time.

Regarding fatalities, our second graph presents a remarkably different image. While "Driver Inattention/Distraction" is still a problem, "Unsafe Speed" has a more concerning association with death rates, occasionally rising with time. This suggests that while distracted driving at moderate speeds is more likely to cause injuries, high-speed collisions are less common but have a higher potential for fatalities.

When we examined how these variables intersected over time, we found that whereas some initiatives might have contributed to a decrease in a particular kind of accident, others either continued or even grew. Our data's temporal component helps us identify the times when particular actions worked and the times when they didn't, providing important insights for next traffic safety plans.

This thorough evaluation provides law enforcement with useful information while also helping local leaders comprehend the nature of auto accidents. They may adjust their teaching efforts to target the most important problems, such stopping distracted driving and enforcing speed limits, with the help of our study. Additionally, the data helps the authorities target the most dangerous behaviors on NYC streets by accurately adjusting their enforcement and preventative actions.

The results of our investigation, in summary, emphasize the necessity of a multimodal strategy that combines law enforcement, infrastructure development, and public education to increase road safety. We think that New York City can significantly reduce the frequency and severity of motor vehicle collisions by concentrating on these important areas.

### Question 2
Question 2: When and where are the most dangerous times?

Importance: This question is significant because it allows public officials as well as the public to know when these automotive accidents happen more frequently. With this information presented, police presence on the roads can be increased during more popular times, as this would encourage drivers to drive safely and more attentively. By adding more police officers only when accidents are more frequent, the government is better able to allocate resources to create a more effective program, rather than keeping them on patrol all day. This information also allows police to create more effective programs as well, such as reducing the speed limit in certain parts throughout the day. This data also provides visualization of where most accidents occur in New York City, by borough. This information is crucial as well, by allowing police to know where to go to hopefully minimize the number of accidents on a daily basis. In addition, this information can allow the public to know which times and in which areas are most dangerous to drive, so they can avoid those settings. Overall, through this information presented, city officials are better able to allocate resources more economically efficiently, and the public can be made aware of which areas are safer and more dangerous throughout the day.

This graphic displays a heat map or other comparable visualization that shows the distribution and frequency of auto accidents in the various New York City boroughs. This kind of depiction makes it easier to pinpoint particular regions or communities where accidents happen more frequently. By emphasizing these areas, the visualization is a useful tool for law enforcement and local officials to identify areas that might need improved road conditions, increased signage, or stricter traffic control measures in order to reduce dangers. The concentration of collisions in some locations may also encourage additional research into local variables, such as road design or common driving habits, that contribute to high collision rates.

This is a time-based analysis that can show how frequently accidents occur at various periods of the day or week. A bar graph or line chart displaying peaks during rush hours or on particular days when accidents are noticeably higher could be used to illustrate this. When crashes are more likely to happen, public leaders and the general public can better allocate resources by increasing police patrols during high-risk periods, for example, according to this type of depiction. It might also have an impact on policy choices on when to change traffic light timing, raise the speed limit during rush hours, or launch focused public awareness programs about safe driving techniques at known risky times.

### Question 3
Question 3, Tripp Trimble Honors Option: What are the most dangerous time and location conditions for cyclists?

Importance: This question is significant for the safety of cyclists in New York City. The information provided shows the injuries and deaths related to cycling in New York City broken down by month, time of day, and zip code. This information is vital to the safety of cyclists in the city because it shows the conditions in which cyclists are most in danger. Drivers and cyclists can learn when and where to be on highest alert on the roads, and police are able to diagnose potential problems with traffic codes road city infrastructure, allowing them to implement programs and legislation that may save lives and reduce injuries.

This graphic shows the cyclists injured and killed from July 2012 - December 2023 in New York City. The line graph shows a cyclical pattern of injuries and deaths, with highs around the Summer months, typically June through September, and with troughs in the Winter months, typically from December to February. There is a smooth cycle shown in the injury grapgh with clear high and low seasons. The trends within deaths are slightly more sporadic, however the death counts still tend to be highest in the Summer months and lowest in the Winter. This trend makes sense, as citizens are more likley to cycle during seasons with warmer weather. The higher volume of cyclists druing these seasons may explain some of the increase in accidents, but it is also important for cyclist and drivers to be more cautious during these months.

This graphic breaks down the times of day in which the most accident happen. As seen in the top line graph, the number of injuries gradually increase thorughout the day, peaking around 5 pm, then decreasing gradually until about 4 am. This cycle is likely related to traffic levels, but the line chart depicting deaths shows more about the severity of the accidents thorugout the day. This chart shows spikes of cycling related deaths at 8 am, 5 pm, and late at night from midnight to 1 am. These spikes in accident severity are likely due to more dangerous driving activities as citizens commute to and from work or home from night time activities. This information shows that these are the times that drivers, cyclists, and police should be most aware and cautious. 

<img width="1056" alt="Screenshot 2024-04-28 at 5 10 19 PM" src="https://github.com/tripptrimble2/ToeWarmer/assets/150174342/b2dec33a-974f-4350-bb55-a6b073d8800b">

Finally, this map shows the locations where there is most danger for cyclists. This maps shows a calulated field that counts each injury as a level one danger and each death as a level 3 danger, or [Number Of Cyclist Injured] + ([Number Of Cyclist Killed] * 3). The map uses color to depict the most dangerous areas, which are the darkest. This information can show cyclists which areas to avoid and guide police and government officials as to which areas need an increase in safety resources or changes in traffic laws.

## Manipulations applied to the data set for analysis:
<img width="675" alt="Screenshot 2024-04-26 at 3 21 26 PM" src="https://github.com/sobaworm/ToeWarmer/assets/164225733/66fab6d1-351e-4ad8-aa62-2cee1ac16119">
In order to prepare the dataset for this analysis, a number of changes would be performed on it, beginning with data cleaning to eliminate or impute missing values and standardize inputs like dates and addresses. To make the geographical analysis simpler, feature engineering would be crucial, for example, in the creation of time bins or location clusters. In order to rank collisions according to their consequences, data aggregation would also be crucial, adding up incidents by date and place and maybe developing a severity index. To investigate their impact on collision rates, additional statistics such as traffic volume or meteorological conditions may also be integrated. These modifications improve the depth and dependability of the results and help to refine the dataset for in-depth research.
